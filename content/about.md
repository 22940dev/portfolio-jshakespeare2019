I’ve been making websites and other digital products for about ten years. I’m primarily a front-end web developer, which means I spend most of my time writing code with languages like JavaScript. I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of design and code; in my experience they are usually two sides of the same coin.

I’m a strong proponent of [human-centered design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmM0kRf8Dbk&vl=en). When we set out to make a product, we are embracing an opportunity to make the user’s life better. That is an exciting job to have!

For the past two years I have worked at [Quartz](https://qz.com), a business-focused news organization based in New York, where I work on the product team as an engineering manager. Previously I worked at web design agencies where I built things for companies like Time magazine, British Airways, BMW and Volkswagen. 

I don’t do much client work any more, so this website is mostly a showcase of my personal work and my blog rather than any sort of portfolio. I am sometimes available for consulting work though; if you have a project in mind I would be happy to talk to you.

If you’d like to contact me, my email address is [j@jshakespeare.com](mailto:j@jshakespeare.com). You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeshake), [GitHub](http://github.com/jshakes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-shakespeare-40784435/).
